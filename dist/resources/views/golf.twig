                <h5>Our Course</h5>
                <div class="row">
                <p>Recognized as one of Southwestern Ontario’s fastest growing Golf Resorts, Rochester Place Golf Club is a parkland style design. The course provides a fun and challenging round of golf for all caliber of players. The completely renovated course meanders through a blend of mature trees, newly sculpted berms alongside strategically placed ponds and waterways to create several risk reward holes. The course conditions rival the best parkland style courses province wide. Some have called our greens, “The Best Putting surfaces in Windsor”.</p>
                <p>Rochester Place Golf Club can be enjoyed from our forward tees at 5210 yards (Slope 110 & Rating 70.6 for Women) or challenged from or back tees at 6400 yards (Slope 123 & Rating 70.4 for Men). We pride ourselves on pace of play. Our pace of play for 9 holes is 2 hours 5 minutes and 4 hours 10 minutes on a relatively busy day with a pace that can be played much quicker based on course utilization. Due to the course location, Belle River Ontario, you can enjoy one of the longest golf seasons in the country.</p>

                <div class="course-title"><h6><span>1</span> Par 4 | HCP 11</h6><hr class="dashed"></div>
                <div class="course-description">
                    <p>This opening hole is a short, yet relatively tight Par 4, demanding smart club selection and precision is needed. Mature trees line both sides of the fairway and are particularly tight along the right side, challenging big hitters who drive the green by cutting the corner of this sharp, dogleg. A well-placed, mid-to-long iron off the tee will leave a short approach to the forward sloping green, which is protected by a bunker on the right front and water on the far left.</p>

                <div class="course-description">
                    <p>Hole 2 marks the course's first Par 5. For the majority of players, this is a true 3-shot hole, from the tips as well as from the front tees due to the presence of a creek 90 yards in front of the green. The tee shot requires some left-to-right movement to allow any chance of reaching the green in two, since a long, straight drive will likely find the grove of trees through the fairway. If you try to reach the green in two, the second shot must carry over the creek in an upward putting surface that typically features a back right corner pin.</p>

From there, the hole takes more of a left bend so position off the tee is crucial if a birdie is the objective here.

                    <p>The inward nine begins with a medium-length Par 4. The smart play from the tee is a long-iron or fairway Medal to a tight landing area in front of the creek that runs through the fairway at roughly 250- yards. Longer hitters will be tempted to clear the water, but be cautious of the severely upward sloping and elevated green and bunker protecting the back.
